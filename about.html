<p><i>"To be inspired is great, to inspire is incredible."</i></p>

<p>Hi, I am Nikunj Jain.</p>

<p>I am a lifelong learner and a goal-oriented person who loves to stay organized, updated, and be responsible for the things that he owns. </p>

<p>I help organizations to build software products and solve business problems. My <i>laser-focus  strategy</i>, <i>whatever it takes attitude</i> combined with <i>effective problem solving skills</i> and <i>quick learning ability</i> help me to face any challenge with strong confidence.</p>

<p>I am a Scorpio and an Ambivert by nature. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to travel to new places, I like to spend a weekend at home.</p>

<p>If youâ€™d like to get in touch, feel free to drop an email at nikunjj46@gmail.com or say hello through any of the social links below.</p>
