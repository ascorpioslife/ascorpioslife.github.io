<blockquote class="blockquote">"To change ourselves effectively, we first had to change our perceptions ~Stephen R. Covey"</blockquote>


<p>- Be the kind of person who isn't afraid to ask someone if they are okay twice if they say they are, but lool like they aren't.</p>
<br>
<p>- Be that kind of person who smiles at people even if they don't smile back </pr>
<br>
<p>- Be the kind of person you wished for when no one was there for you. </p>
<br>
<p>- Be the kind of person who is brave enough to stand alone in a crowd for what is right. </p>
<br>
<p>- Be the kind of person who remembers the seeds after getting a lot of fruits. </p>
<br>
<p>- Be the kind of person who has enough empathy even if the situations are totally against. </p>
<br>
<p>- Be that person because we need more people like that in the world. </p>
<br>
<p>- Be that person because people like that are rarer than the rarest diamond and gold. </p>
