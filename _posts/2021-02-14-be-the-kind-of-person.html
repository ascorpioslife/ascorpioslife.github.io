<p>- Be the kind of person who isn't afraid to ask someone if they are okay, twice, even if they say they are, but look like they aren't!</p>
<br>
<p>- Be the kind of person who smiles at people even if they don't smile back! </p>
<br>
<p>- Be the kind of person you wished for when no one was there for you! </p>
<br>
<p>- Be the kind of person who is brave enough to stand alone in a crowd for what is right! </p>
<br>
<p>- Be the kind of person who remembers the origin after reaching the destination! </p>
<br>
<p>- Be the kind of person who has enough empathy even if the situations are totally against it! </p>
<br>
<p>- Be that person because we need more people like that in the world! </p>
<br>
<p>- Be that person because people like that are rarer than the rarest diamond and gold! </p>
<br>
