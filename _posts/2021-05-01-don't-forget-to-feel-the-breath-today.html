<p>Don't forget to feel the <i>breath</i> today,</p>

<br>

<p>because,</p>

<br>

<p>If I look at someone who is trying <i>hard</i> to breathe,</p>

<br>

<p>If I look at someone who is trying hard to find <i>the air</i> to breathe,</p>

<br>

<p>I would fold my hands to you to not to take <i>it</i> for granted,</p>

<br>

<p>I would beg to you to not to take <i>anything</i> for granted,</p>

<br>

<p>So,</p>

<br>

<p>please take the deepest <i>breath</i> today,</p>

<br>

<p> a <i>breath</i> which will run through every part of your body, </p>

<br>

<p>a <i>breath</i> full of gratitude and thankfulness,</p>

<br>

<p>a <i>breath</i> which you will always remember,</p>

<br>

<p>a <i>breath</i> which these humans are pricing, without knowing that its actually <i>priceless</i>!</p>
