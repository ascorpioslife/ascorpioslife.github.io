<p>Hello World! </p>

<p>First thing first, a warm welcome to my site, "A Scorpio's life.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Reason</h2>

<p>I have an enormous love for learning new things. While learning is necessary, sharing knowledge is equally important. I always wanted my platform where I can share my learnings, ideas, experiences, and thoughts.  "A Scorpio's Life" is the platform I've developed to share all such things. </p>



<h2 class="section-heading">The Name</h2>

<p>As the name reveals, I am a Scorpio. I don't have very much interest in the field of astrology, however, I believe that I possess many of the qualities of the 8th zodiac sign, Scorpio. </p>

<p>To the new beginnings! </p>

<p>Thanks for reading.<p>
