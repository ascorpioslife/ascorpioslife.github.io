<blockquote class="blockquote">How do people use some simple psychological tips to have better conversations? Or What are the purposes of many hidden things that you see every day? Or What if you could travel with the speed of light?</blockquote>

<p>If these things excite you, then you, my dear friend, have landed in the right place.</p>

<p>According to a Harvard study, challenging your brain with mental exercise is believed to activate processes that help maintain individual brain cells and stimulate communication among them. Many people have jobs that keep them mentally active. Pursuing a hobby, learning a new skill, volunteering, or mentoring are additional ways to keep our minds sharp.</p>


<p>In this technology-driven world, picking up a new skill or learning how things function has become a lot easier than ever. Recently, video-based content has become a favorite for many individuals, and there is a strong reason behind this. Our brains can process visuals much quicker than they can text. About 90% of the total information transmitted to our mind is visual.</p>

<p> Keeping all these in mind, I present three YouTube channels that will assist you in this process.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Bright Side</h2>

<p>Bright Side has been one of my favorite channels of all time. The channel has more than 35 Million subscribers and is actively posting videos on recent discoveries, space exploration, true stories, fitness, fun tests, and riddles, or useful tips for self-improvement, psychology, gadgets, and many more fascinating topics. Their content is quite realistic and represented in a very engaging way with great visuals.</p>
